This report serves as a comprehensive log of what I accomplished over the two semester of research under Apoorv Agarwal and Owen Rambow. In short, I concretely defined the codeword detection problem, ran naive experiments on the problem which led to the process of systematically creating a synthetic corpus for the codeword problem, defining baseline tests, preparing datasets for such baseline tests, and finally modifying an polysemic embedding algorithm for the codeword problem. I also include extraneous results that are extensions of this main research (but do not belong to the main body of research).

This is two semester effort (Autumn 2015 and Spring 2016) for two research courses: COMS W3998 (Autumn 2015) and COMS W4901 (Spring 2016).
